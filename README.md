# Relational-Databases

Hey Coach,

So I couldn't do every step in this project because I only did goal 2. and to complete the whole project you need to get data from goals 1, 2 and 3. As I only did goal 2 I used that data to reverse it to SQL. I Created schemas and mock data for the “Bike Shop” and “Music Player” apps from the Init 2 goal.  Though I learnd a lot of new things with SQL. especialy I didn't have enough experience with it. Like what a database table is and how to create it and what columns and data types are, and how they are used within a database, what a primary key is and why it is needed, how to insert data into a table, how to find data on a database using queries, what it means to aggregate data and how to use some common aggregate functions, how to filter data with SQL using the WHERE keyword, how to sort data with SQL using the ORDER BY keyword and how to Create tables. Pretty much I learnd how to use Select and Insert and implement WHERE, LIMIT, ORDER BY, LIKE, AND/OR, HAVING, IN and JOIN in my SQL database code. but to be frank I am still getting used to work with PostgreSQL syntax. but I am getting there.  thank you for understanding.
